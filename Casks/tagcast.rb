  caveats <<~EOS
    Stop any running Tagcast before upgrading; a second copy reuses the existing server.
    Open Tagcast from Applications, or run tagcast-cli --open in a terminal.
    Settings and sign-in tokens are kept in ~/.tagcast and remain after uninstalling.

    Tagcast is not Developer ID signed or notarized. If macOS blocks the first launch,
    use System Settings > Privacy & Security > Open Anyway after reviewing the download.
